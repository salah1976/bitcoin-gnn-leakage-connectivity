#Sample Dataset

This directory can contain a small sample of the processed benchmark for demonstration purposes. The sample is not intended to reproduce the paper's reported performance. The sample dataset contains 10,000 transactions (5,000 fraud and 5,000 non-fraud transactions) provided exclusively for demonstration and code-validation purposes.

The complete benchmark contains 1,687,072 transactions distributed across six chronological snapshots and will be released separately upon publication.
